    <h1>Types of Hackers</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>1.White hat hackers</h2>
        <p>White hat hackers are cybersecurity professionals who use their skills legally to help protect organizations. Often called "ethical hackers," they perform penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security audits to identify and mitigate security weaknesses in networks and systems. White hat hackers follow a strict code of ethics and work with authorization, helping organizations strengthen their defenses against cyber threats. Many white hat hackers are certified professionals employed by companies or hired as consultants, playing a crucial role in the field of cybersecurity by developing and implementing proactive measures to safeguard digital assets from potential attacks.
        </p><hr>
        <h2>2.Black hat hackers</h2>
        <p>Black hat hackers are individuals who exploit systems and networks with malicious intent. Unlike ethical hackers, they operate illegally, breaking into systems to steal data, disrupt services, or install malware. Black hat hackers often target sensitive information, such as personal, financial, or proprietary data, which they may sell on the black market or use for identity theft, fraud, or ransomware. Their motivations range from financial gain to personal or political agendas. These hackers use a variety of methods, including phishing, social engineering, and advanced malware, to bypass security protocols and carry out unauthorized activities.</p><hr>
        <h2>3.Grey hat hackers</h2>
        <p>Grey hat hackers operate in a morally ambiguous zone, often without explicit permission but without harmful intent. They may identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, then report their findings to the organization or the public, sometimes seeking a reward. Unlike black hats, grey hat hackers don’t typically exploit their findings for malicious gain, yet they don’t adhere to strict ethical guidelines like white hats. Their actions can expose organizations to risks, though many argue they contribute to overall cybersecurity by highlighting weaknesses. Companies sometimes compensate or hire grey hats for further security insights and threat prevention.
        </p><hr>
        <h2>4.Script kiddies</h2>
        <p>Script kiddies are inexperienced or novice hackers who use pre-made tools, scripts, or programs developed by more skilled hackers. Lacking deep technical expertise, they typically engage in hacking for attention, personal amusement, or minor disruptions rather than for financial gain or sophisticated attacks. Script kiddies often lack an understanding of the underlying techniques in hacking and instead rely on easily accessible resources to perform basic cyber attacks, such as website defacements or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Although considered lower-skilled hackers, they can still cause significant disruptions, especially to unprotected or poorly secured systems.</p><hr>
        <h2>5.Hacktivists</h2>
        <p>Hacktivists are hackers driven by social, political, or ideological motivations rather than financial gain. Using hacking as a form of protest, they aim to draw attention to specific causes or to disrupt organizations and governments they view as unjust. Hacktivists use tactics such as website defacement, data leaks, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to make their statements publicly. Well-known hacktivist groups, like Anonymous, focus on high-profile targets and leverage media coverage to amplify their messages. While their actions may bring awareness to various causes, they can also create widespread disruption and pose legal implications.</p><hr>
        <h2>6.Blue hat hackers</h2>
        <p>Blue hat hackers are external security experts brought in by companies to conduct pre-launch testing and vulnerability assessments. Often employed on a temporary or project-based basis, they play a critical role in evaluating new software, applications, or systems for potential security flaws. Blue hats work with company permission but are not regular employees. Their primary objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be exploited by attackers post-launch. This pre-emptive testing approach enables companies to fortify their systems, improve overall security, and deliver more resilient products to customers, reducing post-launch risks and strengthening customer trust.
        </p><hr>
        <h2>7.Red hat hackers</h2>
        <p>Red hat hackers, sometimes known as "vigilante hackers," actively pursue and counter black hat hackers. Unlike white hats, they often take aggressive, unauthorized actions to disable or retaliate against malicious actors. Red hats might infiltrate black hat networks or disrupt their activities by launching attacks on malicious servers, effectively shutting down the black hats’ operations. Operating in a legal and ethical gray area, red hat hackers’ actions are driven by a desire to protect others from cyber threats. However, their methods can blur the line between defense and offense, making them controversial within cybersecurity communities.
        </p><hr>
        <h2>8.Green hat hackers</h2>
        <p>Green hat hackers are beginners eager to learn and grow in hacking. Often motivated by curiosity and a passion for technology, green hats experiment with different techniques and tools, often in safe or educational environments, such as cyber labs or online platforms. They typically lack formal knowledge but are committed to gaining skills, understanding cybersecurity concepts, and learning about vulnerabilities and exploits. Green hats represent the early stages of a hacker’s journey, and many eventually pursue certifications and become ethical hackers or cybersecurity professionals, applying their skills to protect systems and develop safer digital environments.
        </p><hr>
        <h2>9.Nation-state hackers</h2>
        <p>Nation-state hackers are government-sponsored hackers who conduct cyber espionage and attacks on other countries. Tasked with gathering intelligence, they target government agencies, corporations, and infrastructure to obtain confidential information or cause disruption. Nation-state hackers often possess high levels of skill, advanced resources, and sophisticated techniques, making them difficult to defend against. These hackers are motivated by national interests and can impact international relations by influencing foreign policy, military strategy, and economic stability. Their operations are covert, aiming to avoid detection, and they often target sensitive systems, such as energy grids, communication networks, and financial institutions.
        </p><hr>
        <h2>10.Cyber terrorists</h2>
        <p>Cyber terrorists use hacking to incite fear and cause significant harm to society. Targeting critical infrastructure like power grids, transportation systems, or financial institutions, they aim to disrupt essential services and threaten national security. Motivated by ideological, political, or religious beliefs, cyber terrorists seek to achieve their goals by destabilizing governments or instilling fear in populations. Their actions can lead to severe economic and social repercussions, and they often work in organized groups with substantial resources. Cyber terrorism poses a significant challenge for governments, as these attacks require robust cybersecurity defenses and international cooperation to prevent and respond effectively.
